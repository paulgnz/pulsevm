/// and buy seconds of CPU on every node that saw it -- repeatable for free,
/// because a transaction rejected for irrelevant signatures never reaches the
/// mempool and so is never deduplicated.

/// not available here: the same code path validates blocks, and a subjective
/// timeout there would let two nodes disagree about the same block. So the bound
/// has to be objective.

/// The floor is set by `pulse.prods`: with `MAX_PRODUCERS = 125`, satisfying its

/// that, while capping recovery at ~20ms rather than seconds. Real transactions
